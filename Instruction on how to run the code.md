This project will generate a random question for a student from a JSON file (JSON file is serving as a database).

Source file: JSON file.

To run the code, you need to install Tkinter and import the following:
Import Tkinter the entire module (from Tkinter import *)
Import ttk from Tkinter
Import random
Import JSON
import message box from Tkinter.

The code can be run from the visual studio console or command line. Ensure the JSON file and the python file are saved in the same directory before running the code.
After running the code, it will display GUI with a multiple-choice question, and once you choose the answer, click next to go to the next page. In the end, it will open a result window.
